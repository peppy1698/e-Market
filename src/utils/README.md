A simple React e-commerce app that allows users to browse and add products to a shopping cart.

# React Components: The app is built using various React components such as ProductList, ProductItem, Cart, CartItem, etc. These components are reusable and can be rendered multiple times throughout the app.

# React State: The app uses React state to manage the data of the products and the cart. The state variables are updated using the useState hook from React.

# React Context API: The app uses the Context API to share the cart data across multiple components.

# React Router: The app uses React Router to implement client-side routing. This enables users to navigate between different pages of the app without having to perform a full page refresh.

# Styling: The app uses CSS to style the various components and elements of the UI.
